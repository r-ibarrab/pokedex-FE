This is a technical test project for a Fullstack position at [Filup](https://filup.mx/)

## Requirements

To run this project you just need to have node and npm install. After you clone it on your local machine, you just run npm install to get all dependencies. After this, you just run npm start to get your frontend ready. If you are going to run the server locally, you don't need to change anything, the url for fetching the api is targeting localhost:3002, which is where the backend side is going to run.
